# E-Commerce Product Rating & Review Component

This application was built as part of a four person team, where I was responsible for creating the Rating & Review component for a clothing ecommerce website.


<h2>To Start</h2>
Fork/Clone the repository
Once in editor:
<ul>
  <li>npm install</li>
  <li>npm run build</li>
  <li>npm start</li>
</ul>
<br />
The site is hosted on LocalHost at port 1111.

<h2>Viewing Product Reviews</h2>
Users who are interested in seeing reviews of a product can view the overall rating for the product, a star rating breakdown, what % of customers recommend the product, and a list of reviews submitted from other users.
<br />
The user can dig deeper into reviews with their ability to sort reviews by helpfulness, relevance, and newest as well as the ability to filter by star ratings.

<h2>Adding Product Reviews</h2>
Users can write new product reviews for the product that is currently on the page. Each user can provide a star rating (1-5), rate each characteristic that applies to the product, write a title/review body, recommend the product, and upload pictures of the product they received.
<br />
Once the review is submitted, it will appear in the list of reviews for the product on the page.
